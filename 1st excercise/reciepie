        <h1>Delicious Pancake Recipe</h1>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Butter or oil for cooking</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Do not overmix; the batter should be slightly lumpy.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or oil.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip the pancake and cook the other side until golden brown, about 1-2 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Enjoy your delicious homemade pancakes!</p>
