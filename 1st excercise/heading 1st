        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create web pages. 
        It structures the content of a webpage, allowing developers to organize text, images, and links in a meaningful way. 
        Using tags like <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong> for paragraphs, HTML ensures that content is displayed correctly in a web browser.

        CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, works hand-in-hand with HTML to style and format web pages. 
        While HTML focuses on structure, CSS handles design, including colors, fonts, and layout. 
        By keeping design separate from content, CSS allows for greater flexibility and reusability across multiple pages.

        JavaScript is the programming language of the web, used to add interactivity and dynamic features to websites. 
        From form validation to interactive maps, JavaScript enables web applications to respond to user input and provide a more engaging experience. 
        Together with HTML and CSS, it forms the backbone of modern web development.
